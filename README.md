JavaScript::QuickJS::XS - Perl XS binding for the
[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html) Javascript engine.

This is a work in progress. I could use help with the following questions:

* How do you create a JS array from C? Query is size? Add / remove elements?
* How do you create a JS object from C? Query its keys / property names? Add /
  remove properties?
* How do you deal with timers?
